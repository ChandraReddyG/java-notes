## Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable

1. Using var (try not to use. prefer var or const)
2. Using let
3. Using const
4. Using nothing (undeclared variables)

```javascript

// variables using var
var value = 'hello';
var num = 202;

// variables using let
let lvalue = 'hello';
let lnum = 204;
let _lastName = "Johnson";

// defining multiple variables in one line
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

// variables using const
const cvalue = 'hello';
const cnum = 205;

// undeclared variables
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
```

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. <br>
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. <br>
If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var. <br>

## VAR
To fully understand why var is bad, you first need to understand three core concepts of Javascript.

### Declaration vs Initialization
> var myVariable; // This is 'undefined' here!

This assigns a default value of undefined to the declared variable. When you are ready to use it, you can initialize the variable with a value.

> myVariable = 'a value';

### Hoisting
A var declared anywhere in a function will be automatically included at the top level of that function and assigned ‘undefined’.
```javascript
function hello( assign ) {
  console.log(message); //prints undefined
  if (assign) {
    var message = "Hello there!";
    console.log(message); // prints "Hello there!"
  }
}
```

Same code with let will throw error <br>
A variable declared with let will be automatically Block scope, and it will not be Hoisted. So, from our example above:
```javascript
function hello( assign ) {
  console.log(message); // Reference Error: message is not defined
  if (assign) {
    let message = "Hello there!";
    console.log(message); // prints "Hello there!"
  }
}
```


## CONST

The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015). <br>
Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared. <br>
Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned. <br>
Variables defined with const have Block Scope. <br>
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared. <br>

```javascript
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
```
