# Java 8 New Features

## Lambda Expression
Java programming language, a Lambda expression (or function) is just an anonymous function, i.e., a function with no name and without being bounded to an identifier. They are written exactly in the place where itâ€™s needed, typically as a parameter to some other function.

They enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions let you express instances of single-method interfaces (referred to as functional interfaces) more compactly.

## Functional Interface
Functional interfaces are also called Single Abstract Method interfaces (SAM Interfaces). As name suggest, they permit exactly one abstract method inside them. Java 8 introduces an annotation i.e. @FunctionalInterface which can be used for compiler level errors when the interface you have annotated violates the contracts of Functional Interface.

```
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MFunctionalInterface {
    public void funInterface();
}
```
